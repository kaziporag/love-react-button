Adds a lightweight, circular heart-and-count ‚ÄúLove React‚Äù button to any post, page, or custom post type.  
Zero dependencies beyond jQuery, works instantly via the `[love_react]` shortcode, and includes an optional Elementor widget for drag-and-drop use.

* **Customisable** ‚Äî drop in your own SVG or style the `.love-react-btn` class.  
* **Developer-friendly** ‚Äî clean OOP‚Äêready code, nonces, escaping, and hooks.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with caching plugins? =

Not in v1.0.0&mdash;the click is ‚Äúlove once per browser‚Äù. Toggle support is on the roadmap.

= Where are counts stored? =  
In the post meta key `_love_react_count`.
